# Dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles. It contains configurations for the following programs:

- Wezterm (Terminal emulator)
- Zsh (shell, used with oh-my-zsh)
- Visual Studio Code
- Fusuma (Customize trackpad gestures)
- Neovim (Terminal text editor)
- Installation scripts for dotfiles (not fully tested)

## Installation
Move or remove conflicting files in your home directory and the files in the repo before running the script.

```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diego09310/dotfiles/main/.setup/install.sh)"
```
